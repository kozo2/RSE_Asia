## History

The RSE Asia Association was launched during a project under the [Open Life Science Cohort-4 programme (OLS-4)](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/projects-participants/#) programme by [Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal](https://saranjeetkaur.github.io/About-Me/) and [Jyoti Bhogal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoti-bhogal-a20705163/), under the Mentorship of [Anne Fouilloux](https://github.com/annefou). It was launched on Thursday, 14th October 2021, which is also the first [International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html). At the launch event we conducted activities for contributing to [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Both Saranjeet and Jyoti graduated from the OLS-4 during early 2022 (graduation certificates below).

Furthermore, under the [Pilot Mentoring Programme](https://society-rse.org/events/pilot-mentoring-programme/) of the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/), Saranjeet is working on the building community around the RSE Asia Association, mentored by [Michelle Barker](https://www.researchsoft.org/people/). Jyoti is working on a project titled "Building Pathways for Onboarding to Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association and Adoption of Code of Conduct" as mentee in the  the [Open Life Science Cohort-5 programme (OLS-5)](https://openlifesci.org/ols-5/projects-participants/#) under the mentorship of [Malvika Sharan](https://malvikasharan.github.io/).
